/**
 * Controls the discoveryClient object.  The discoveryClient object is created
 * by the googletvremote plugin during initialization.
 *
 * The discovery client searches for Anymote sessions on the local network.
 * This is the recommended way to find Google TV devices.  However some networks
 * may block the Discovery Client.  If that occurs you can attempt to pair with
 * a device by manually entering an IP address and assuming the Anymote port is
 * 9551.  Ideally the discovery client would determine the Anymote port, but all
 * existing Google TV's use port 9551, so that is a good guess if the discovery
 * client fails.  The discovery client functions include:
 *     startDiscovery(advertisedDeviceCallback, errorCallback)
 *     stopDiscovery()
